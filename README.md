# Chitter-fullstack-app
This is one of my projects where I created a twitter clone type of fullstack application. It allows you to post peeps (tweets) on a homepage that actually logs you in and stores data in a MongoDB cluster. Technologies used include, JS, React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Axios,  NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, bcrypt, Jasmine.
