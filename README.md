# Chitter: A Full-Stack Twitter Clone App

This is one of my projects where I created a twitter clone type of full stack application.

Welcome to Chitter, a full-stack application that allows users to post and view "peeps" (tweets) once they have registered and logged in. This project was built using a variety of technologies, including:

Technologies used include:

- JavaScript
- React
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Axios
- Node.js
- Express
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- bcrypt
- Jasmine

To create Chitter, the first step was to plan the layout and structure of the app. This involved creating wireframes to visualize the placement of different components on each page. Once the component hierarchy was established, the static pages of the app were built using this hierarchy as a guide.

Next, the app's state management was implemented. This included using the Axios library to make GET and POST requests to retrieve and modify data as needed.

To support the functionality of the app, a NodeJS backend server was set up using the Express library to handle routing and handle GET and POST requests. The Mongoose library was also added to allow the app to access a MongoDB cluster and retrieve data such as tweets and information about the users who posted them.

In addition to these features, a login system was implemented using POST requests to authenticate users and grant them access to the app.
